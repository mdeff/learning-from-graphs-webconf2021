# Learning from Graphs: From Mathematical Principles to Practical Tools

A hands-on tutorial presented by [Michaël Defferrard](https://deff.ch) at [The Web Conference 2021](https://www2021.thewebconf.org/program/tutorials).

> A graph encodes relations between objects, such as distances between points or hyperlinks between websites.
> You will learn how to extract information about that relational structure.
> This information is crucial to characterize an object through its local connectivity or an entire graph through its global connectivity.
> On top of that structure, a network may possess data about the objects or the relations, such as a point's color or an hyperlink's click-through rate.
> You will learn how to leverage a graph to analyze this data.
> Leveraging the structure that underlies data is an important concept, from physical symmetries dictating conservation laws to the efficiency of convolutional neural networks.
> The tutorial is built on deep mathematical principles but will walk you from the basics with an emphasis on intuitions and working knowledge.

**Intended audience**: people with theoretical or practical interests about graphs and data on graphs. Adapted to both researchers and practitioners.

**Prerequisite knowledge**: scientific python programming, basic linear algebra, no prior knowledge about networks is necessary.
